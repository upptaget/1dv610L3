# Assignment 3

### Post-It application with registration and and login system.

The vision of this application is a small crud application that enables the user to save and share notes with titles, called "Posts". 

So far, 2 out of 5 existing use cases are fulfilled. Confirmed by testing. In other words, this is not a finished application. 

The Use and Test cases can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/upptaget/1dv610L3/wiki), as well as a guide to setting up a couple of sql-database tables to make the application runnable. There you will also find a link to the Use and test cases for the login system.

Have fun.
